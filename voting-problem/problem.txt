We have a voting problem!

There is a person in charge who has these capabalities:

	1- Set start time and end time
	2- Insert the names of nominees
	3- Max number of voters (max_n)
	4- Insert and validate the wallets of voters (individually and together)


A few conditions alter the election:

	1- If the number of electors becomes more than max_n
	2- If less than 50% of voters participate
	3- If a signed voter is again added to validated voters
	
	
There are also some rules:

	1- Voters can only choose one nominee
	2- Voters can also change their vote
	3- If all nominees had equal n. of votes, there will be no winner
